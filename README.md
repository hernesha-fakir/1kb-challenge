# 🎟️ Guess the Ticket Price

A fun, lightweight browser-based game where you guess if concert ticket prices are higher or lower than a reference price. Test your knowledge of ticket prices for popular artists like Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Coldplay, and more!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. You start with a random reference price
2. An artist is shown, and you must guess if their ticket price is **higher** (⬆️) or **lower** (⬇️) than the current reference price
3. After each guess, the current artist becomes your new reference price
4. Continue guessing until all artists have been revealed
5. Your final score shows how many correct guesses you made out of 10
